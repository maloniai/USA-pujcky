## Methodology Overview

1. **Borrowers served** are counted when an applicant completes the Loan AI Portal pre-qualification flow and consents to lender sharing. Duplicate entries are deduplicated by hashed SSN + email.
2. **Loan originations** are counted when a lender partner posts a funding confirmation to our secure webhook, after which finance reconciles against lender settlement reports.
3. All data pipelines feeding these metrics are monitored via dbt models (`fct_borrowers`, `fct_originations`). Daily QA checks run in Snowflake to flag anomalies above a Â±1.5% variance threshold.
4. The finance controller reviews and signs off on cumulative metrics at quarter-end. Documentation is stored in the internal Confluence space `Compliance > Metrics Substantiation`.
