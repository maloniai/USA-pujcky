# State Pages Fix - Summary Report

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** https://loan-platform.com/states/california/ returned 404 Not Found  
**Root Cause:** Missing dynamic route for individual state pages

---

## Problem Diagnosis

The sitemap (`/src/app/sitemap.ts`) was generating URLs for all 50 state pages:
- `/states/alabama`
- `/states/alaska`
- `/states/california`
- ... (47 more)

However, the corresponding dynamic route **did not exist**:
- ❌ `/src/app/states/[state]/page.tsx` was **missing**
- ✅ `/src/app/states/page.tsx` existed (states listing page)

This caused all state detail pages to return 404 errors.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 2. Build and Verification

```

**Results:**
