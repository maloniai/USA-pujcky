          <p>
            If you borrow <strong>$10,000</strong> over <strong>3 years</strong> at an annual interest 
            rate of <strong>12%</strong>, your monthly repayment would be approximately <strong>$332</strong>. 
            The total amount repayable would be <strong>$11,952</strong>, which includes <strong>$1,952</strong> in 
            interest charges.

            This is a representative example only. Your actual interest rate and monthly repayment will depend on 
            your personal circumstances, credit history, loan amount, and loan term. Rates typically range from 
            6% to 20% per annum for personal loans in Australia.

          <p className="text-yellow-800 text-xs">
            Before applying for any loan, carefully consider whether you can afford the monthly repayments. 
            Lenders are required to assess your financial situation under responsible lending obligations. 
            Failure to make repayments on time will negatively impact your credit file and may result in 
            default listings, legal action, and additional costs. Only borrow what you can comfortably afford to repay.
