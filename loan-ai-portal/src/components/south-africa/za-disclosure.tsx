          <p>
            If you borrow <strong>R10,000</strong> over <strong>36 months</strong> at an annual interest 
            rate of <strong>24%</strong>, your monthly repayment would be approximately <strong>R393</strong>. 
            The total amount repayable would be <strong>R14,148</strong>, which includes <strong>R4,148</strong> in 
            interest charges.

            This is a representative example only. Your actual interest rate and monthly repayment will depend on 
            your personal circumstances, credit history, loan amount, and loan term. Rates typically range from 
            10% to 28% per annum for personal loans in South Africa.

          <p className="text-yellow-800 text-xs">
            Before applying for any loan, carefully consider whether you can afford the monthly repayments. 
            Borrowing money costs money. Failure to make repayments on time will negatively impact your credit 
            record with credit bureaus and may result in legal action and additional costs. Only borrow what 
            you can comfortably afford to repay.
