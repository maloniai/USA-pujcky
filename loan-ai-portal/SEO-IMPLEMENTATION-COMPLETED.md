## ⚠️ Known Issues (NON-BLOCKING)

### Issue: Mexico City Pages Missing generateStaticParams()
**Status:** ⚠️ NOT FIXED (separate from SEO work)  
**Error:**
```
Error: Page "/mx/[region]/[city]/page" is missing param in "generateStaticParams()"
```

**Impact:**
- Does NOT affect homepage SEO fixes
- Does NOT block deployment of global directory
- Mexico pages (4 regions, 50+ cities) will need generateStaticParams() added similar to Poland

**Next Steps:**
- Add generateStaticParams() to `/src/app/mx/[region]/[city]/page.tsx`
- Import mexicoCities data array
- Map cities to static params: `mexicoCities.map(city => ({ region: city.regionSlug, city: city.slug }))`
- Can be fixed post-deployment without affecting other markets
