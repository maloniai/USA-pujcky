3:Tae7,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How does New Zealand consumer credit law protect me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA) regulates all credit providers in New Zealand. All lenders must be licensed by FMA, conduct responsible lending assessments, provide clear disclosure of all costs and terms, and handle your personal information according to the Privacy Act. You have the right to dispute resolution through the New Zealand Financial Complaints Authority (Financial Services Complaints Ltd (FSCL)) if issues arise."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How quickly can I get funds after loan approval?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Funding times vary by lender. Online lenders can approve and disburse funds within 24-48 hours if all documentation is complete and verification checks pass. Traditional banks may take 3-7 business days. Providing complete and accurate documentation upfront speeds up the process. Once approved, funds are transferred directly to your New Zealand bank account."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What documents do I need to apply for a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Typically you need: New Zealand driver's licence or passport, proof of income (recent payslips, tax returns, or bank statements), proof of address (utility bill or bank statement), bank statements (usually 3-6 months), and employment verification. Some lenders may request additional documents depending on the loan amount and your credit profile."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a loan with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, some lenders specialize in loans for consumers with impaired credit history. However, expect higher interest rates and potentially lower loan amounts. Your credit file is checked through Equifax, Experian, or illion. Focus on rebuilding your credit by paying existing debts on time, reducing credit utilization, and correcting any errors on your credit file."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are my rights as a borrower in New Zealand?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Under New Zealand law, you have the right to: receive clear information about all loan costs before signing (including comparison rate), a credit assessment to ensure the loan is not unsuitable for you, a cooling-off period to cancel the agreement, early repayment without excessive penalties, protection of personal information under the Privacy Act, access to your credit file, and dispute resolution through Financial Services Complaints Ltd (FSCL). All fees and interest rates must be clearly disclosed, and lenders cannot charge excessive fees or unreasonable interest rates."}}]}a:T225d,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":["Organization","LocalBusiness","FinancialService"],"@id":"https://loan-platform.com/#organization","name":"Loan AI

All lenders must be licensed by FMA, conduct responsible lending assessments, provide clear disclosure of all costs and terms, and handle your personal information according to the Privacy Act. You have the right to dispute resolution through the New Zealand Financial Complaints Authority (Financial Services Complaints Ltd (FSCL)) if issues arise."},{"question":"How quickly can I get funds after loan approval?","answer":"Funding times vary by lender. Online lenders can approve and disburse funds within 24-48 hours if all documentation is complete and verification checks pass. Traditional banks may take 3-7 business days. Providing complete and accurate documentation upfront speeds up the process. Once approved, funds are transferred directly to your New Zealand bank account."},{"question":"What documents do I need to apply for a personal loan?","answer":"Typically you need: New Zealand driver's licence or passport, proof of income (recent payslips, tax returns, or bank statements), proof of address (utility bill or bank statement), bank statements (usually 3-6 months), and employment verification. Some lenders may request additional documents depending on the loan amount and your credit profile."},{"question":"Can I get a loan with bad credit?","answer":"Yes, some lenders specialize in loans for consumers with impaired credit history. However, expect higher interest rates and potentially lower loan amounts. Your credit file is checked through Equifax, Experian, or illion. Focus on rebuilding your credit by paying existing debts on time, reducing credit utilization, and correcting any errors on your credit file."},{"question":"What are my rights as a borrower in New Zealand?","answer":"Under New Zealand law, you have the right to: receive clear information about all loan costs before signing (including comparison rate), a credit assessment to ensure the loan is not unsuitable for you, a cooling-off period to cancel the agreement, early repayment without excessive penalties, protection of personal information under the Privacy Act, access to your credit file, and dispute resolution through Financial Services Complaints Ltd (FSCL).
