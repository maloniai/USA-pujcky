It requires all credit providers to be registered with the NCR, limits interest rates and fees, ensures transparent disclosure of costs, and gives consumers the right to a credit assessment before approval. The NCA also protects your personal information and provides mechanisms to resolve disputes with credit providers.\"},{\"question\":\"How quickly can I get funds after loan approval?\",\"answer\":\"Funding times vary by lender and application complexity. Online lenders can approve and disburse funds within 24-48 hours if all documentation is complete and verification checks pass. Traditional banks may take 3-7 business days. Providing complete and accurate documentation upfront speeds up the process. Once approved, funds are transferred directly to your South African bank account.\"},{\"question\":\"What documents do I need to apply for a personal loan?\",\"answer\":\"Typically you need: a valid South African ID document, proof of income (latest 3 months payslips, bank statements, or financial statements for self-employed), proof of residence (utility bill not older than 3 months), bank statements (usually 3-6 months), and employment verification. Lenders may request additional documents depending on the loan amount and your credit profile. Having all documents ready accelerates the application process.\"},{\"question\":\"Can I get a loan with bad credit or if I'm blacklisted?\",\"answer\":\"Yes, some lenders specialize in loans for consumers with impaired credit records. However, expect higher interest rates and potentially lower loan amounts. Being \\\"blacklisted\\\" typically means you have adverse credit information recorded with credit bureaus. Under the NCA, negative credit information can be removed after specific periods (typically 1-5 years depending on the type). Focus on rebuilding your credit by paying existing debts on time and maintaining responsible financial behavior.\"},{\"question\":\"What are my rights as a borrower in South Africa?\",\"answer\":\"Under the NCA, you have the right to: receive clear information about all loan costs before signing, a full credit assessment to prevent reckless lending, a cooling-off period to cancel the agreement, early settlement without excessive penalties (limited to 3 months interest), protection of personal information under POPIA, transparent credit reports, dispute resolution mechanisms, and protection from harassment.
