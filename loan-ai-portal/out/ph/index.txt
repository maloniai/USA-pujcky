3:T97f,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is APR and how is it calculated?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"APR (Annual Percentage Rate) represents the total cost of the loan expressed as an annual percentage. It includes the interest rate, fees, and all other costs related to the loan. In the Philippines, the BSP regulates lending practices to ensure fair lending. APR helps you compare offers from different lenders based on the actual total cost."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How quickly can I receive funds after approval?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The timeline depends on the lender and verification complexity. Online loans can be approved in 24-48 hours with funds deposited directly to your bank account. Traditional bank loans may take 3-7 business days. Complete and accurate documentation speeds up the process."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What documents are needed to apply for a personal loan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Generally you need: valid government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID), proof of income (certificate of employment, payslips for employees, or ITR/financial statements for self-employed), bank statements (last 3-6 months), proof of billing/residence, and completed application form. Some lenders may require additional documents based on the loan amount."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a loan with bad credit history?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, some lenders offer loans to individuals with less favorable credit history, but typically with higher interest rates and smaller loan amounts. It's important to improve your credit score by paying existing debts on time and maintaining responsible financial behavior. Some lenders also evaluate current repayment capacity, not just credit history."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are my rights as a borrower in the Philippines?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You have the right to: clear and complete information before signing, protection against abusive lending practices under RA 11765 (Financial Consumer Protection Act), file complaints with BSP or SEC if needed, privacy and protection of personal data under RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act), and fair treatment with transparent fees. All loans must comply with BSP regulations and the Truth in Lending Act (RA 3765)."}}]}a:T225d,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":["Organization","LocalBusiness","FinancialService"],"@id":"https://loan-platform.com/#organization","name":"Loan AI

percentage. It includes the interest rate, fees, and all other costs related to the loan. In the Philippines, the BSP regulates lending practices to ensure fair lending. APR helps you compare offers from different lenders based on the actual total cost."},{"question":"How quickly can I receive funds after approval?","answer":"The timeline depends on the lender and verification complexity. Online loans can be approved in 24-48 hours with funds deposited directly to your bank account. Traditional bank loans may take 3-7 business days. Complete and accurate documentation speeds up the process."},{"question":"What documents are needed to apply for a personal loan?","answer":"Generally you need: valid government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID), proof of income (certificate of employment, payslips for employees, or ITR/financial statements for self-employed), bank statements (last 3-6 months), proof of billing/residence, and completed application form. Some lenders may require additional documents based on the loan amount."},{"question":"Can I get a loan with bad credit history?","answer":"Yes, some lenders offer loans to individuals with less favorable credit history, but typically with higher interest rates and smaller loan amounts. It's important to improve your credit score by paying existing debts on time and maintaining responsible financial behavior. Some lenders also evaluate current repayment capacity, not just credit history."},{"question":"What are my rights as a borrower in the Philippines?","answer":"You have the right to: clear and complete information before signing, protection against abusive lending practices under RA 11765 (Financial Consumer Protection Act), file complaints with BSP or SEC if needed, privacy and protection of personal data under RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act), and fair treatment with transparent fees.
