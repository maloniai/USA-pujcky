We compare FCAC-regulated credit providers operating in Canada. All lenders must comply with federal and provincial lending regulations including the Criminal Code of Canada Section 347 (maximum 60% annual interest rate). Loan approval, rates, and terms are subject to each lender&#x27;s assessment criteria. Representative example: A $5,000 personal loan over 2 years at 19.99% APR has 24 monthly payments of $254.59, total repayment $6,110.16, total interest $1,110.16. Payday loans are subject to provincial regulations with maximum borrowing terms typically 62 days or less. Rates, fees, and regulations vary by province.
